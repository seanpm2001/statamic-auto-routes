# Auto Routes

This addon updates routes when somene edits the slug for a page that has a collection mounted. The plugin will only update the routes configuration when there was already a route available.

Download the plugin and add it to your addons folder.

I'm my no means a skilled programmer at the time of writing. Feel free to treat this code as your own.
